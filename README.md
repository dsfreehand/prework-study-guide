# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created to investigate and demonstrate basic abilities in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
It stands as a marker in my development to show where I began and as a reference point should I need to review basic concepts.
While I had a basic understanding of HTML and markup prior to the class, this project was a great introduciton to Git functions.
